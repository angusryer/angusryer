## About Me

I _really_ like to learn and often prioritize it. A few notable exceptions are:

👨‍👩‍👦‍👦  Family

🌋  Escaping narrowly with my life intact

- I play music and I'm nearly always singing or tapping.
- I used to commute 350km per day in an electric vehicle. No range anxiety, but don't commute that much.
- I like to fly airplanes that don't have engines.
- I rode my bicycle from Vancouver to Winnipeg.
- I'm a licensed electrician.
- I started an e-commerce business and found enough success to feel confident in entrepreneurial endeavors.
- **I adore my family.**
- I transitioned to full-time software development when COVID hit, thanks to @JonBarson & @LaurenRosentzveig.
- I manage mild depression and anxiety with a strong emotional toolkit from these experiences.
- I'm a code mentor at the NASA Space Apps Challenge and passionate about humanity's growth into space. I volunteer for space-related projects where I can.
- I made a sextant.
- I probably sound like a kid, but I'm in my mid-thirties.

## ENOUGH!
Maybe I'll post more about my stuff. Either way, you can learn more about me on LinkedIn and Twitter.
