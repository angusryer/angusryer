# Greetings and salutations üåé üåç üåè

**To the reader:** the following is part-resume and part-fun and really just a parts list.

## Production Apps
### [I.Liv.](https://iliv.io/) is an app that supports women (along with a cohort-based professional program) in acheiving professional goals alongside personal balance. We use these things:
- TypeScript and React Native
- Node/Express, micro-service architecture
- MongoDB with custom field-level data encryption mechanisms
- Auth0 as authentication server
- AWS for deplyoyments, along with all the fancy VPC and routing configurations for top-notch security
- Azure DevOps for task management and CI/CD pipelines
- Jest and Maestro fro unit, integration and E2E testing

### [Purchase Order Pro](https://www.popro.app/) (PO Pro) is a SaaS and mobile-app combo for construction companies that I built. I used these things:
- TypeScript
- Node/Express
- PostgreSQL
- React & NextJS
- Google Cloud Platform for SQL
- Firebase/store/auth
- CI via Github actions
- Jest for units & Cypress for e2e
- React Native for the mobile side

### Other, less-prominent but still functional, technological experience
- Vue, Ionic
- Java and Kotlin, Objective-C and Swift (to create and/or extend native modules in the React Native apps described above)
- State managers: redux, mobx, jotai
- Cache-syncs: react-query, my own custom implementations for sync'ing images across multiple devices in I.Liv.
- Amazon Web Services (Cognito, Dynamo, specifically)
- Programming in functional and object-oriented paradigms
- Using state machines, data structure and application architecture design
- Custom webpack implementations
- Lots of bash scripting

## On Me

I _really_ like to learn. I often prioritize learning over otherwise. A few notable exceptions are:

üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶  Family

üåã  Escaping norrowly with my life intact

- I play music and I'm nearly always singing or tapping.
- I used to commute 350km per day in an electric vehicle. No need for range anxiety people but don't commute that much.
- I like to fly airplanes that don't have engines (?!).
- I rode my bicycle from Vancouver to Winnipeg.
- I'm a licensed electrician.
- I started an e-commerce business and saw enough success with it to feel confident that I can do things like that.
- **I adore my family.**
- I decided to do software development full time when covid hit. I managed to pull that off somehow. Thank you @JonBarson & @LaurenRosentzveig.
- I can fluctuate between mild depression and anxiety and have a good emotional toolkit from those experiences.
- I'm a code mentor at the NASA Space Apps Challenge and _really_ love humanity's growth into space. I volunteer for space stuff where I can.
- I made a sextant.
- I probably sound like a kid right now but I'm in my mid-thirties.

## ENOUGH!
Maybe I'll post about my stuff. I often don't though. Either way, you can learn more about me on LinkedIn and Twitter.
