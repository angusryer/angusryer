### Greetings and salutations friends 🌎 🌍 🌏

**To the reader:** the following is part-resume and part-fun and really just part-list. Nothing is in any particular order. Don't assume I don't know how to punctuate properly just because you read it that way.

# I'm building my first SaaS application from scratch.
- PostgreSQL, hand-written 🪄 🥸  wooooot
- Firebase/store/auth
- 100% TypeScript (just, like, the intellisense alone...)
- Node/Express
- React & NextJS
- Google Cloud Platform for SQL
- CI via Github actions
- Jest for units & Cypress for e2e

This SaaS is a web-app and mobile app combo, so:
- React Native

What else have I either built something functional with or at least can figure out what I'm doing when I see it?
----
- Vue
- Ionic
- I've worked a bit with strongly-typed languages like C# and Java, and read a lot about them
- redux, mobx, jotai, reducer patterns
- react-query, react-this, react-that, all of Kent C. Dodds' articles
- Mongodb
- Amazon Web Services (Cognito, Dynamo)
- object oriented programming and loving functional
- React Native, _unplugged_ (no expo)
- I know what currying and closures are! State machines! ❤️‍🔥
- Custom webpack
- Custom build scripts
- CLI, man, CLI!
- It's hard to remember, I'll add more later

What I'm saying is I _really_ like to learn. I often prioritize learning over otherwise. A few notable exceptions are:


👨‍👩‍👦‍👦  Family

🌋  Escaping norrowly with my life intact


### Also
----

I play music and I'm nearly always singing or tapping.

I used to commute 350km per day in an electric vehicle. No need for range anxiety people, but don't commute that much.

I like to fly airplanes that don't have engines (?!).

I rode my bicycle from Vancouver to Winnipeg.

I'm a licensed electrician.

I started an e-commerce business and saw enough success with it to feel confident that I can do things like that.

### I adore my family.

I decided to do software development full time when covid hit. I managed to pull that off somehow. Thank you @JonBarson & @LaurenRosentzveig.

I can fluctuate between mild depression and anxiety and have a good emotional toolkit from those experiences.

I'm a code mentor at the NASA Space Apps Challenge and _really_ love humanity's growth into space. I volunteer for space stuff where I can.

I made a sextant.

I probably sound like a kid right now, but I'm in my mid-thirties.

## ENOUGH!



Maybe I'll post about my stuff. I often don't though. Either way, you can learn more about me on LinkedIn and Twitter.
